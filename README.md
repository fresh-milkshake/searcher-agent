# Searcher Agent

AI-powered system for finding interdisciplinary research on arXiv - discovers where one scientific topic is applied in another field.

## What It Does

Automatically analyzes arXiv papers to find intersections between scientific fields. For example:
- Machine learning applications in medicine
- Quantum computing in cryptography  
- Blockchain technology in logistics

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install project dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create `.env` file:

```ini
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=telegram-token-here
# if you have an API key for OpenAI:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
# if you use other providers:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=openrouter-key-here
DATABASE_PATH=database.db
```

### 3. Run the System
```bash
# Start both bot and agent
python main.py

# Or run separately:
python start_bot.py    # Telegram bot only
python start_agent.py  # AI agent only
```

## How to Use

### Set Search Topics

```
/topic "machine learning" "medicine"
```

### Basic Commands

- `/start` - Help and command list
- `/topic "topic1" "topic2"` - Set analysis topics
- `/status` - Current monitoring status
- `/pause` / `/resume` - Control monitoring
- `/history` - View recent findings

## Architecture

- **`bot/`** - Telegram bot interface
- **`agent/`** - AI analysis engine  
- **`shared/`** - Common modules (database, LLM, arXiv)

## Example Output

```
