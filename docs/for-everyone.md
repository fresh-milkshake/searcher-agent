# Why this project matters

Most of us struggle to keep up with the pace of new research. `searcher-agent`
turns this into a background process: it watches for new papers, picks what is
relevant, and explains the essence in everyday language directly in Telegram.

## What you get

- Clear summaries instead of walls of text.
- Gentle explanations for non-technical readers.
- Timely updates without manual searching.

## Typical questions it helps answer

- What is new in my topic this week?
- Is this paper important and why?
- Which 3 ideas are worth my time?

## How to start in 1 minute

1. Add your Telegram token, run the bot.
2. Create a task with your topic and minimal relevance.
3. Receive summaries and highlights in chat.

Shortcuts:

- Create a bot: [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)/[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
- Install uv: [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Examples of messages you’ll see

- A short title (no emojis), 1–3 lines with essence and usefulness, and an arXiv link.
- Human tone, no jargon, under 600 characters.

## Who is it for

- Students, educators, makers, and busy professionals who want signal over noise.

## Privacy and safety
