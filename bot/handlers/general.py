    ðŸ”¬ Hello, {user_name}! I'm your assistant that explores research sources and finds items useful for your goals.

    ðŸ“Œ <b>How it works</b>
    1. You create a task, for example: /task "AI for medical imaging"
    2. I search arXiv, Google Scholar, PubMed, and GitHub, evaluate relevance, and send you clear summaries.
    3. At the end of 50 search cycles, I send you a report with the most relevant and interesting items.

    ðŸ“‹ <b>Main commands</b>
    â€¢ /task "description" â€” create a new research task
    â€¢ /status â€” show current status of your task
    â€¢ /history â€” recent findings that I found interesting
    
    Also, you can add me to your group chat and I will search for you there!
    To achive this, you need to add me to the group chat and use command /set_group.
    If you want to unset group, use command /unset_group.
    
    To see all available commands, use /help.

    ðŸ§­ <b>Tip</b>
    Make your task as specific as possible, so I can find the most relevant items for you.
